Conducts arithmetic operations on polynomials with postfix notation

This program reads in a data file that contain polynomials and arithmetic operations in postfix notation. It stores the polynomials in doubly linked lists and then pushes each polynomial to a stack. Then, it uses overloaded arithmetic operators to perform the appropriate operations on polynomials and stores the result of a polynomial arithmetic expression. I continued this process until there were no more rows in the file. Then, it outputs the final result.
